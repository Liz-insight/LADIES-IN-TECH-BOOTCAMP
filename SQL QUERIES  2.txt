FROM CustomerData
GROUP BY Region;

FROM CustomerData
WHERE DATEDIFF(MONTH, SubscriptionStart, SubscriptionEnd) <= 6
  AND Canceled = 'TRUE';



Calculate Average Subscription Duration for All Customers:
SELECT AVG(DATEDIFF(MONTH, SubscriptionStart, SubscriptionEnd)) AS AvgDuration
FROM CustomerData;


Find Customers with Subscriptions Longer Than 12 Months:
SELECT CustomerID
FROM CustomerData
WHERE DATEDIFF(MONTH, SubscriptionStart, SubscriptionEnd) > 12;



Calculate Total Revenue by Subscription Type:
SELECT SubscriptionType, SUM(Revenue) AS TotalRevenue
FROM CustomerData
GROUP BY SubscriptionType;



Top 3 Regions by Subscription Cancellations:
SELECT TOP 3 Region, COUNT(*) AS Cancellations
FROM CustomerData
WHERE Canceled = 'TRUE'
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY Cancellations DESC;



Total Active and Canceled Subscriptions:
SELECT 
    COUNT(CASE WHEN Canceled = 'TRUE' THEN 1 END) AS CanceledSubscriptions,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN Canceled = 'FALSE' THEN 1 END) AS ActiveSubscriptions
FROM CustomerData;
